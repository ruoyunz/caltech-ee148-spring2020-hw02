Homework #2: Red Light Detection with Convolution

My simple algorithm for red light detection using matched filtering adapted from assignment 1. 

run_predictions will predict the bounding boxes using matched filtering and saves as json.

eval_detector will evaluate the performance of my algorithm using PR curves.
